# EMPLOYEE LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

***The project is build using MERN(MongoDB Express ReactJS NodeJS) with a MongoDB Atlas Database Connection.***

>We have implemented JWT authentication and RBAC (Role Based Access Control) for both Employee and Admin logins. In addition, we enabled email authentication with real-time OTP for employee login. In addition, we have added real-time email notifications for leave status, employee confirmation, and password change activities.
